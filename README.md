Dead-Drop.io
=========
Media dead-drops!

A Node.JS based media sharing app that gives the media you uploaded to the next user!

Dead-Drop.io is a place for media dead-drops. To use it, simply drag and drop a supported file onto this page, or copy and paste a media url into the box. When you share a piece of media, you will get to see the previous users share. No files are stored, its a one time share for the next user. You give one, you get one.
